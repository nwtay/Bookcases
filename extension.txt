This extension enhances the brute-force algorithm used in bookcase.c
via the removal of duplicate bookcases.

As we initialise a new child, we check whether the arrangement of books
in this child has been seen before (function: visitedbefore) in the array
of structures.

If it has, we take one off of the cell counter, and hence overwrite this
child on the next iteration.

The benefit of this is that we use less cells of the array, since all
cells are new arrangements. Therefore, for the same amount of memory allocation,
we should be able to run more iterations, before "no solution".
